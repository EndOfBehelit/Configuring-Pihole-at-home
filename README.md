# Configuring-Pihole-at-home
Guide about how configure a PiHole at home.

# Materials needed

  - 1 x Raspberry Pi 2W (It can be other models, not necessary this one)
  - 1 x microSD card (I used one with 64GB but it can be less)
  - 1 x micro usb charger

# Download Raspberry Pi Imager

Download the Raspberry Pi Imager from the official website: `https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/`. (I used the windows version)

Now insert the microSD in the computer to install the OS and execute the imager.

# Install Raspberry Pi OS

It's needed to choose which model of Raspberry it's going to be used, the OS version and where is going to be installed.

In this case it's going to be used a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W:

For the OS the 64bits recommended version is ok, but the Lite version will be enough for this:

Finally the storage will be the microSD:
